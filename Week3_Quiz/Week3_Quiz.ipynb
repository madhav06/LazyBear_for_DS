Of course, guests who came earlier should be greeted before those who came later. If several guests came at the same time or together, however, you want to greet first the older guests to show them your respect. You want to use a min-heap in the program to determine which guest to greet next. What should be the comparison operator of the min-heap in this case?"

To do this, you've already created a class to store the nodes of DSU and implemented the FindFind method using the path compression heuristic. You now need to implement the UnionUnion method which will both use rank heuristics and update the size of the set. Which one is the correct implementation?"
